     Some common use cases for the SUBTOTAL function:

     1.Subtotal with Filtering: When you have a large dataset, and you want to filter it to view specific subsets,
       the SUBTOTAL function can provide accurate calculations.
     2.Conditional Calculations: You can use the SUBTOTAL function in combination with other functions like SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, etc, 
       to perform conditional calculations on the visible data.
     3.Subtotal with Grouping: If you have grouped data in your worksheet and want to calculate subtotals for each group,
       the SUBTOTAL function can handle

     
6. What is the syntax of the vlookup function? Explain the terms in it?

Sol: The VLOOKUP function in Excel is used to search for a value in the leftmost column of a table and retrieve a corresponding value 
     from a specified column in the same row.

        syntax: =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])
